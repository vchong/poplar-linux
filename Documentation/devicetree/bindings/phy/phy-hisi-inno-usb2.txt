HiSilicon INNO USB2 PHY

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following strings:
	"hisilicon,inno-usb2-phy",
	"hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy".
- #phy-cells: Should be 1. The specifier is the index of the PHY port to
  reference.
- hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: The phandle of syscon used to control PHY,
  followed by a integer cell which defines the syscon register offset used
  to talk to PHY.
- clocks: The phandle and clock specifier pair for reference clock utmi_refclk.
- resets: The list of phandle and reset specifier pairs for each reset signal
  in reset-names.
- reset-names: Should contain "power_on", "utmi0" and "utmi1". The "utmi1"
  should exist only if the device has two PHY port.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Example:

	usb2_phy1: usb2-phy1 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy";
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		hisilicon,peripheral-syscon = <&peri_ctrl 0x120>;
		clocks = <&crg HISTB_USB2_PHY1_REF_CLK>;
		resets = <&crg 0xbc 4>,
			 <&crg 0xbc 8>,
			 <&crg 0xbc 9>;
		reset-names = "power_on", "utmi0", "utmi1";
	};
