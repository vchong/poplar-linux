HiSilicon INNO USB2 PHY
-----------------------
Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following strings:
		"hisilicon,inno-usb2-phy",
		"hisilicon,hi3798cv200-usb2-phy",
- #phy-cells: Shall be 0.
- hisilicon,peripheral-syscon: Phandle of syscon used to control phy.
- hisilicon,phycon-reg: Offset of the phy control register in the syscon.
- hisilicon,port-num: Number of utmi ports. Range [1,2].
- clocks: Phandle and clock specifier pair for reference clock utmi_refclk.
- resets: List of phandle and reset specifier pairs for each reset signal
in reset-names.
- reset-names: Shall be "power_on", "utmi0", "utmi1". Thereinto, utmi[n] is
required only if port[n] exists.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Example:
usb2_phy: phy {
		 compatible = "hisilicon,inno-usb2-phy";
		 #phy-cells = <0>;
		 hisilicon,peripheral-syscon = <&peri_ctrl>;
		 hisilicon,phycon-reg = <0x120>;
		 hisilicon,port-num = <2>;
		 clocks = <&crg USB2_PHY_UTMI_REF_CLK>;
		 resets = <&crg 0xbc 2>,
			  <&crg 0xbc 8>,
			  <&crg 0xbc 9>,
		 reset-names = "power_on", "utmi0", "utmi1";
	 };
